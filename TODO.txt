- favicon

- revise unit tests
	* too much work for now. better make demo and make announcement

- check football-data.org v2 release daily. single final match result field promised.

- 0.001 eth maximal verwenden fuer alle oraclize queries

- Investigate VueJS bet loading optimizations. developer browser plugin shows that flag graphics are loaded more or less sequentially --> some synchrous stuff happening that shouldn't happen I guess.

- VueJS: props validation

- Implement in Bet.sol a retry-fetch (exp.?) backoff

- VueJS: maybe put bet data in vuex store. Might also load faster as bet data is centrally and independently fetched. components will just render vuex data when it
becomes available there. Right now: bet components contain bet state.
	* Leveraging vuex more, will also result in more powerful bet filters (by country, by group, by match start, next X matches, previous X matches,....)

- work with tx.gasUsed to determin if claim/fundFetching/bet(?) worked or instead it moved to cancelled state. In case of cancel, gasUsed should be way less. Adapt feedback messages accordingly: Don't say 'Funding successful', when actually it was moved to cancelled and nothing was funded.

- change prod config back to mainnet (now kovan)

- remove me as a contributor on ethercup github pages. only ethercup account should commit.
	--> reset repo once more

- find all 'TODOS' in the repo and resolve or merge here

- rework funding: when football-data v2 is out, don't ask for fund of 0.008 ether or >5 fetches, but offer 1 fetch for 0.001 ether or so. Button: Fund 1 fetch!
	* Contract not initialized with funds!
	* Users pay for one fund, can start funding anytime after matchStart+1-5min
	* Source of income? Add a buffer of 50%? 10% (min), 20%?

- fix CSS... often ugly. button colors when clicked often wrong
