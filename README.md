Ethercup
========

Bet on your favorite team with Ether for every match in the FIFA worldcup 2018 in Russia.

If you placed your bet(s) correctly, the Ether pool is split among you and others, who betted on the winning team. If you betted on the wrong team, you lose your Ether. In case of a draw between the two
teams, you get your Ether back. The fee is 1% on all payouts.

The design of the deployed Bet smart contracts makes betting fraud- and tamper-proof! Your bets are
safely stored in a smart contract, which will redistribute Ether when the winner is decided. In case something goes wrong (match postponed, external data provider misbehaves), you're always able to get all your Ether back without paying any fee!
